    q: 'Do I need a programming background to join?',
    a: 'Not for the Prompt Engineering course — it is designed for professionals from any background. For the ML & AI program, basic Python familiarity is helpful but not required. We assess your starting point in the orientation call and customise your learning path accordingly.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does 1:1 scheduling work?',
    a: 'After enrollment, you pick session slots from your mentor\'s calendar that fit your schedule. Sessions are typically 60–90 minutes, held via Google Meet with recording. You can reschedule with 24-hour notice.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens if I am not satisfied?',
    a: 'We offer a 7-day full refund policy after your first session. If the mentor isn\'t the right fit, we reassign at no cost. We would rather lose a payment than keep a student who isn\'t progressing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Are the Startup India and Swayam recognitions real?',
    a: 'Yes. We are DPIIT-recognized under Startup India with registration number DIPP103457. Our curriculum quality framework is acknowledged under SWAYAM standards by the Ministry of Education. Both are verifiable on their official portals.',

  {
    q: 'What is the placement guarantee?',
    a: 'We guarantee placement support for 6 months post-completion. If you do not receive a suitable offer within 6 months of completing all program requirements and engaging with our placement process, we extend your support at no additional cost.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Can I pay in installments (EMI)?',
    a: 'Yes. We offer 3, 6, and 12-month no-cost EMI options through leading Indian banks and fintech partners. International students can pay via Stripe in USD, EUR, or GBP.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Will the curriculum keep up with AI advancements?',
    a: 'AI evolves fast and we update curriculum quarterly. As a student, you get lifetime access to all updates including new modules added after your enrollment — at zero extra cost.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is there group interaction or is it fully 1:1?',
    a: 'Your learning is 1:1 with your dedicated mentor. However, you also get access to our private alumni Discord with 2,400+ professionals, monthly group Q&A calls with senior mentors, and peer study groups.',
